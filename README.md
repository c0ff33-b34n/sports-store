# Sports Store
A simple but realistic e-commerce site created with **Angular** and **Bootstrap**

Created by Adam Freeman, featured in the book Pro Angular 9 published by Apress.

I have implemented the code while following the book. Updating code where necessary to fix issues, make small improvements and adhere more closely with TypeScript standards.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
